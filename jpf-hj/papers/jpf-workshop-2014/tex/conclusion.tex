\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}

To summarize, we have introduced VR-lib for model checking of HJ programs in JPF.
VR-lib supports the use of phasers as well as GPRs. GPRs in combination with JPF
has been shown to be an effective strategy for model checking small programs for
race conditions. Opportunities for future improvements in this area are as follows:
\begin{compactitem}
\item support for actors, exceptions, and finish accumulators in VR-lib
\item automatic static insertion of GPR annotations (this will relieve the
burden from the programmer and provide stronger guarantees that the program is
annotated correctly)
\item support of multi-variable annotation to increase readability of annotated
programs
\item test the effectiveness of GPRs for larger HJ programs
\end{compactitem}
