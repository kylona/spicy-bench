% Author: Chris Monson
%
% This document is in the public domain
%
% Options for this class include the following (* indicates default):
%
%   phd (*) -- produce a dissertation
%   ms -- produce a thesis
%
%   electronic -- default official university option, overrides the following:
%                 - equalmargins
%
%   hardcopy -- overrides the following:
%                 - no equalmargins
%                 - twoside
%
%   letterpaper -- ignored, but helpful for the Makefile that I use
%
%   10pt -- 10 point font size
%   11pt -- 11 point font size
%   12pt (*) -- 12 point font size
%
%   lof -- produce a list of figures in the preamble (off)
%   lot -- produce a list of tables in the preamble (off)
%   lol -- produce a list of listings in the preamble (off)
%
%   layout -- show layout lines on the pages, helps with overfull boxes (off)
%   grid -- show a half-inch grid on every page, helps with printing (off)
%   separator -- print an extra instruction page between preamble and body (off)
%
%   twoside (*) -- two-sided output (margins alternate for odd and even pages,
%     blank pages inserted to ensure that chapters begin on the right side of a
%     bound copy, etc.)
%   oneside -- one-sided output (margins are the same on all pages)
%   equalmargins -- make all margins equal - ugly for binding, but compliant
%
%   twosidetoc - start two-sided margins at the TOC instead of the body.  This
%     is sometimes (oddly) required, but be aware that it will make the page
%     numbering seem screwy, e.g., the first four full sheets of paper will
%     have number i-iv (not shown, though), and the next sheets will each have
%     two numbers, one for each side.  I suspect that most people don't look at
%     the roman numerals anyway, but it is a weird requirement.
%
%   openright (*) -- force new chapters to start on an odd page
%   openany -- don't use this, it's ugly
%
%   prettyheadings -- make the section/chapter headings look nice
%   compliantheadings (*) -- make them look ugly, but compliant with standards
%
%   chaptercenter -- center the chapter headings horizontally
%   chapterleft (*) -- place chapter headings on the left
%
%   partmiddle -- Part headers are centered vertically, no other text on page
%   parttop (*) -- Part headers at top of page, other text expected
%
%   duplexprinter -- Ensures that the two-sided portion starts on the right
%     side when printing.  This is not for use in submission, since the best
%     thing to do there is to print everything out one-sided, then take it down
%     to the copy store to have them do the rest.  It does help to save trees
%     when you are printing out copies just to look at them and fiddle with
%     things.
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
%
% The rest is up to you.  To fiddle with margins, use the \settextwidth and
% \setbindingoffset macros, described below.  I suggest that you
% \settextwidth{6.0in} for better-looking output (otherwise you'll get 3/4-inch
% margins after binding, which is sort of weird).  This will depend on the
% opinions of the various dean/coordinator folks, though, so be sure to ask
% them before embarking on a major formatting task.

% The following command fixes my particular printer, which starts 0.03 inches
% too low, shifting the whole page down by that amount.  This shifts the
% document content up so that it comes out right when printed.
%
% Discovering this sort of behavior is best done by specifying the ``grid''
% option in the class parameters above.  It prints a 1/2 inch grid on every
% page.  You can then use a ruler to determine exactly what the printer is
% doing.
%
% Uncomment to shift content up (accounting for printer problems)
%\setlength{\voffset}{-.03in}

% Here we set things up for invisible hyperlinks in the document.  This makes
% the electronic version clickable without changing the way that the document
% prints.  It's useful, but optional.
%
% NOTE: "driverfallback=ps2pdf" chooses ps2pdf in the case of LaTeX and pdftex
% in the case of pdflatex. If you use my LaTeX makefile (at
% http://latex-makefile.googlecode.com/) then pdftex is the default There are
% many other benefits to using the makefile, too.  This option is not always
% available, so use with care.
