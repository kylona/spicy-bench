Habanero is a task parallel language that provides correctness guarantees. Even
so, programs can be non-deterministic due to deadlock or data-race. This paper
presents a verification-specific library for Habanero intended to assist in
discovering deadlock and data-race. The library has been extensively tested with
Java Pathfinder (JPF) to give confidence in its correctness. This paper further presents an
implementation of gradual permission regions in JPF to find deadlock and
data-race in Habanero programs. JPF detects sharing, and the user annotates such
sharing with permission regions or isolation. Verification only schedules on
permission regions or isolation to elicit data-race and deadlock. The approach
is sound with respect to proving programs free of such behavior. The results
from an empirical study show significant reductions in verification cost, where
cost is controlled with the size of the permission regions, at the risk of
rejecting programs that are actually free of data-race and deadlock.
