\section{Results}
For comparison between JPF's PreciseRaceDetector and permission regions we
collected a series of measurements on benchmarks that perform work in parallel.
These benchmarks utilize a wide variety of HJ features, including: async,
isolated, finish, and phasers.  Increasing the complexity level of
synchronization (finish < isolated < phasers) increased both the state-space

\ref{tab:perf} we increase synchronization complexity). However, the use of GPRs
reduces the state-space by as little as one order of magnitude and as much as
two orders of magnitude. The reduction in overhead can likely be attributed to
the lack of shared-access choice generators.
